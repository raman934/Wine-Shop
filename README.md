# WinerApp

This is an open source Android App , made to deliver wine to homes just like any other food delivery app.

## The problem Winer App solves :

As India had approached the lockdown phase 3, wine shops are being opened to lift the economy, while itâ€™s been observed that social distancing norms are being thrown to the wind as people tend to make beelines at liquor shops. Several liquor vends in Delhi had to be shut only hours after they reopened as scores of people gathered outside, violating social distancing norms . Winer is proposed specifically as a solution to this problem, to make sure everyone gets to buy wine while staying at home during this quarantine time of COVID-19, all over India . Winer is an android app through which people can buy wine online safely from nearby shops. Winer enlists only those wine shops verified by the Indian Government . People can order wine from the wine shops from their nearby region, preferably neighborhood,town or city without having to step outside the house. Once received the product, customer can confirm the delivery.
